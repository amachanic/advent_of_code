# AoC 2024 - SQL Server (2017)

SQL Server solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

Very little attempt was made to properly optimize most of these solutions; I was just trying to get the right answer, in a reasonable amount of time (i.e., not hours). Some solutions run very quickly, some take a few minutes.

I also did not really follow what I consider to be wonderful coding standards. So please do not consider this to be an examtple of how to write production SQL code.

Thank you, and enjoy.
